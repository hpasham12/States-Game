# State Paths
#### How well do you know your states?

---

Developed by: Harshita Pasham

The project I want to implement is a game that tests the player's knowledge about a state in the continental United 
States and it's borders. There will be a starting state and an ending state. The user must begin at the starting state 
and type in the name of a state that borders the previous one in order to form a path to the ending state. The only 
background knowledge I have is that I know the location of most of the states in the US relative to each other. I just 
thought that this would be a fun game to test one's knowledge of the locations of states. If I can get this game to 
work, I could challenge my friends to see if they know their states as well as I do. 

I was thinking about adding a map of the continental United States without labels so for that I would use Cinder to 
import the image and the graphics. I plan on using the nlohmann/json library as the external library for this project.

By the end of the first week I hope to have all the graphics done with. By the end of the second week I want to try and 
have all the logic done for the states. By the end of the third week I should finish connecting the front end and back 
end of the game. If I finish earlier than expected, I want to try and add a timer and keep track of the specific user 
and their respective high scores in a database. I can also try and add options to restart the round or pause the game.
